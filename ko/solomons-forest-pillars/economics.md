# ECONOMICS

In order to realize our motto 'Enjoy Life', we are going to build and develop an in-game economic system. Like other blockchain games, income in the game can connect to real income. Digital assets owned by each player are owned by that, and those assets can be converted into crypto-currency. Assets represented by SEED can be used to purchase LEAF or NFTs. They can be used in the game.

#### Enjoy the play itself.

The rewards received from quests and the rewards for the time invested can go back to real player beyond the space. This is the direction Solomon's Forest is going, and it is the future we are aiming for. Extracting in-game virtual earnings into real-world income, We believe our motto is to be able to actively enjoy the game.

We hope many people to be 'Enjoy Life' with the future economy we think.
