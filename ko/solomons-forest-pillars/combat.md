# 전투

Players fight using Demon Cards. Demon Cards are outfitted with weapons. Players can start the battle by choosing a demon castle or a dungeon depending on their actual location. You choose a demon castle to fight other players, and the dungeon battles monsters.

Depending on the distance, the battle time, equipment damage, and movement cost will vary. However, the greater the distance, the greater the reward. It is important to note that equipment damage caused by combat is permanently affected.

When a player ranks higher by winning battles, their status rises and financial gains occur. And as an additional reward, you will be given the right to create sub castles, rocks, trees, etc. near the main castle in the area.
