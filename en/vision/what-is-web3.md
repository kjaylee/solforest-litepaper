# WHAT IS WEB3?

The profits of the game should go to the contributors of the game ecosystem. The biggest contributors are game users. Ultimately, we want to create games that users can generate revenue for. That's the web3 we think of.

For this vision, we will build a sustainable game ecosystem. Specifically, we will concentrate our focus across five pillars.

1. Release Solforestâ€™s game series. (At this point, three games are being planned.)
2. Increase the Solforest ecosystem members.
3. Activating the Solforest community with players.
4. The entire game logic goes into the Solana on-chain.
5. The endless is Solforest game and economics.
